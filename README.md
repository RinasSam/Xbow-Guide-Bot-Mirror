# Xbow Guide Bot: The Free and Open Source Xbow Matchup Guides Discord Bot.   
      
  	
This is the official Xbow Guide Bot repository. It should be a fossil repository, if you see this on github/gitlab, then it has been mirrored from the original repository.  
        
The Xbow Guide Bot is a Discord bot I created so that Xbow players could upload their own guides/improve other people's guides, and view them as needed.    
  
The matchup guides are in a separate github [repository](https://github.com/RinasSam/Xbow-Matchup-Guides).
